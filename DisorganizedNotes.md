# Fiber-Nylon Sintered Composite

Idea: chopped glass fiber mixed with Nylon powder.  Cram it into a 2-piece steel/aluminum mold, use bolts to provide pressure, throw it into the kiln to melt it all together.

Problem: Nylon powder is hard to come by.  and aspensive

Idea: Layer glass fiber with nylon fabric, and do the same as mentioned.

Problem: Nylon isn't gonna be good at temperatures like inside an engine. 

Idea: Use Something like PEEK which IS good to those temps.

Problem: does PEEK even come in fabric? 

> Answer: Yes, and holy shit is it aspensive!

Idea: Kevlar comes in fabric.  And Kevlar is thermoplastic so it could concievably work.

Problem: Kevlar needs to be **HOTTTTTTTTT** but maybe a steel mold could handle it.

Problem: After reaching sintering temp, mold halves will come together, relieving pressure and maybe not densifying like I want.

Idea: Springs?

Problem: Springs don't do too good at high temperatures

Idea: Throw money at the problem with Inconel Springs! Yeah! that'll work! /s

Idea: fish out the mold every so often to tighten the bolts until they don't tighten anymore

Idea: pull a vacuum on the mold somehow.

Problem: How exactly? 

Idea: Whole thing done in a vacuum chamber, use radiant heat from quartz heaters to heat the mold, insulate inside of chamber with rockwool and aluminum foil. 

Problem: Jesus fucking christ this is getting complicated
