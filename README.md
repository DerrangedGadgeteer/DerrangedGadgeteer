# Front-Burner Projects:

## Remodeling the Estate House

Top priority is refurbishing a 200-year-old farmhouse for my and my dearest to move into.  Lack of progress on all other projects is entirely laid at the feet of this monsterous task.

> Note: This project is dark for privacy reasons.

## 1969 F100 Track Truck
Custom Rat Rod pickup built for road-course performance.  Junkyard and improvised parts, Maximum fun for minimum dollars.
